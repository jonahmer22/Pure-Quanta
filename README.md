# Pure Quanta

**Pure Quanta** is a basic quantum computer simulation written in pure C. This project simulates qubits using state vectors of complex numbers and implements a few fundamental quantum gates, including the Hadamard gate, Pauli-X, Pauli-Y, Pauli-Z, and the CNOT gate.

> **Note:** This project is in very early alpha. The code serves as a foundation for simulating quantum operations on qubits. Future updates will add features such as quantum measurement, additional gates, circuit composition, and performance improvements.

## Features

- **Qubit Representation:**  
  Uses an array of `Complex` structures (with double-precision real and imaginary parts) to represent the quantum state of a system of qubits. The state vector for an *n*-qubit system is a complex vector of size \($2^n$\).

- **Initialization:**  
  Initializes the system to the \($|0\cdots$ $0\rangle$\) state. In mathematical notation, the initial state is:

  $|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$

- **Quantum Gates:**  
  - **Hadamard Gate:** Creates superposition by transforming:

    $|0\rangle \to \frac{|0\rangle + |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |1\rangle \to \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}$
  - **Pauli Gates:**  
    - **Pauli-X:** Flips \($|0\rangle$\) and \($|1\rangle$\):

      $X = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$
    - **Pauli-Y:** Applies a phase shift and flips states with \($\pm i$\) factors:
        
      $Y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}$
    - **Pauli-Z:** Flips the phase of the \($|1\rangle$\) state:
      
      $Z = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}$
  - **CNOT Gate:** A two-qubit gate that flips the target qubit if the control qubit is in the state \($|1\rangle$\). Its matrix representation in the computational basis is:
  
    $\text{CNOT} = \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 0 
    \end{pmatrix}$

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (such as `gcc` or `clang`).
- Standard C libraries.

### Compilation

To compile the program, run:

```bash
make
```

### Running the Simulation

After compiling, run the executable with the number of qubits as a command-line argument. For example, to simulate a system with 4 qubits:

```bash
./pure-quanta 4
```

The program will initialize the state vector and print the complex amplitudes for each basis state.

## Code Overview

- **Initialization (`init`):**  
  Allocates memory for the state vector (of size \($2^n$\) for *n* qubits) and initializes the state to \($|0\cdots$ $0\rangle$\).

- **Gate Functions:**  
  Each single-qubit gate (Hadamard, Pauli-X, Pauli-Y, Pauli-Z) takes three parameters: the state vector, the total number of qubits, and the target qubit index. Internally, each function calculates index pairs corresponding to the target qubitâ€™s 0 and 1 states and updates the state according to the gate's matrix.  
  The CNOT gate operates on a control qubit and a target qubit, swapping state amplitudes as needed.

- **Main Function:**  
  Processes the number of qubits from the command line, initializes the state, applies example gates (if enough qubits are provided), prints the state vector, and cleans up allocated memory.

## Future Enhancements

- **Quantum Measurement:** Implement measurement operations with probabilistic state collapse.
- **Additional Gates and Circuits:** Add support for more complex gates and gate combinations.
- **Error Handling and Unit Testing:** Develop automated tests to verify state transformations and circuit behavior.
- **Performance Optimizations:** Optimize memory and computation for larger qubit counts.
